Matching files (input csv -> python code -> output csv):
Note: I don't think I spell separate (I wrote seperate) correctly once in all of my code so keep that in mind...

unitCSVMaster.csv + simplifyUnits.csv -> headerSplit.py -> parserData.csv
comparison.csv -> seperateFunc.py -> seperatorTest.csv
typePath.csv + unitPath.csv -> pathReaderFunc.py -> (currently does not work: encoding issue)
simplifyUnits.csv -> distanceFunc.py -> distanceTest1.csv + distanceTest2.csv
(None) -> matchFunc.py -> (None)
